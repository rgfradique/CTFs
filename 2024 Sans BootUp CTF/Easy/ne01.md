# Network - ne01
## Description
```
Connect to the network service at 3-ne01.bootupctf.net port: 8225 and find a way to get the flag.
```

Upon connecting we receive a long list of hex numbers separated by `:` :
```
...0x##:0x##:0x##...
```

Repeating the requests I noticed that we get a new string every sencond. From this, I assumed that the string would be hidden somewhere in the long list, and would be present in every new string. 
Started by converting each byte into its corresponding ascii char and inspecting the output. Noticed the word `Basic` being repeated every time, which allowed me to narrow down the piece of string that's always present by trial and error.
From here I built a simple python script to isolate the area around `Basic` for any string and output the flag:

```
from pwn import *

conn = remote('3-ne01.bootupctf.net',8225,level='error')

conn.recvline()
rec = (conn.recvline())
rec = rec.decode('utf-8')
l = (rec.split(":"))
l = l[:-1]
out = ""
for n in l:
    numb = int(n,16)
    if numb > 47 and numb < 123:
        out = out+chr(numb)
#print(out)

text = "Basic"
hexd = ""
for l in text:
    hexd = hexd + (hex(ord(l))) + ":"
pos = (rec.find(hexd))

flag = (rec[pos-4*4:pos+27*4])
f = flag.split(":")
f = f[1:]
print(f)
res = ""
for n in f:
    fo = chr(int(n,16))
    res = res + fo
print(res)
```
