# Network - nm02
## Description
```
Access the network service at 3-nm01.bootupctf.net port: 8230 and find a way to get the flag.
```
Accessing the service we get back a list of hex values as:
```
...
## ## ##
...
```

Same as before, found a common string that was repeated on each new output, in this case it spelled `Flag`, and used it as anchor for each subsequent request.
The flag was the string decoded as utf-8, which had the text flipped upside down.

```
from pwn import *
from base64 import *
import binascii

conn = remote('3-nm01.bootupctf.net',8230,level='error')

conn.recvline()
rec = (conn.recvline())
rec = rec.decode('utf-8')

ind = rec.split(" ")
ind = ind[:-1]

#out=''
#for i in ind:
#    cur = int(i,16)
#    #print([i,cur],end=' ')
#    if cur >47 and cur < 123:
#        print(chr(cur),end='')
#
text = "Flag"
hexd = ""
for l in text:
    hexd = hexd + (hex(ord(l))) + " "

hexd = hexd.replace("0x", "")
pos = (rec.find(hexd))

flag = (rec[pos:pos+60*2+1])
f = flag.split(" ")
f = f[:-1]
res = ""
for n in f:
    fo = chr(int(n,16))
    res = res + fo

truef = f[6:-1]
res = ""
he = ""
for n in truef:
    #print([n,chr(int(n,16))])
    fo = chr(int(n,32))
    res = res + fo
    he = he + n
    #print(chr(int(n,32)-i),end=' ')

#print(res)
print((binascii.unhexlify(he)).decode('utf-8'))
```
